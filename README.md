# Hey you 👋 welcome to my profile.

### About me 🌱

My name is Maximiliano Alonso and I'm currently learning programming.

I'm a member of cohort 17 at Holberton School Uruguay, school that I chose to become a Software Engineer. 

Our cohort started at january 2022 so I will be graduated on november 2022. 

I chose Holberton for my education because their curriculum is very complete, but also they focuse in our softskills, teaching us how to become better professionals everyday.

I'm a person who likes being in constant learning and having different kind of challenges in a professional and educational way.
